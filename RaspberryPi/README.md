=======================

Ever wished you could quickly reload the form in ServiceNow using a shortcut, regardless of what browser you are in?  Here you go...

Creates a UI Script called ReloadForm
Reloads the form when Alt key is double-pressed
You must press the key twice within 300ms
To change the key that is used, simply update event.keyCode = 18 to whatever key code you want
